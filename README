Welcome to Pantry, comand-line nutrient analysis!

This code is mostly undocumented and should be considered
unstable. Nonetheless it should compile and work. I'm not sure
anyone can make sense of it without a manual, but intrepid
adventurers have inquired about the code.

I posted the code to serve as an example of what you can
do with multiarg, a library to parse command lines. Unlike this
project, that code is documented and quite usable:

This is a Haskell version of Pantry, which is a successor to an
older C++ version, which is documented but has an awkward user
interface. It's here:
